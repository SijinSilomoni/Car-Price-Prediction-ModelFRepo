# Car-Price-Prediction-ModelRepo
The car price prediction model aims to analyze the factors influencing car prices in the US market. Using a dataset of various car types, the model identifies key variables that significantly impact pricing, helping the business understand the relationship between features like engine size, fuel type, and car model on the final price.

Five regression algorithms were implemented to predict car prices, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor. These models were evaluated based on performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the best model, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.891191, MAE of 0.133739, and RMSE of 0.159419.

The project also focused on feature importance analysis to determine which variables most affect car pricing. Hyperparameter tuning was carried out to further optimize model performance, ensuring that the model delivers accurate predictions and provides actionable insights for the business's pricing strategy.
